                <p>Founded in 2015, The Green Machine&#169 began as a family business in Cherry Hill, NJ.
                    In 2013, Owner Jerry Watson's seven-year-old daughter was diagnosed with a rare disease
                    which greatly restricted her dietary habits. Quick thinking father and at-home chef,
                    Watson was able to cook up several vegan style dishes which were not only satisfying
                    his daughter's needs, but were also very delicious. He soon realized his talents and
                    opened a small restaurant to help raise money for his daughter's medications and doctor
                    appointments. He called it The Green Machine&#169, after what he was acclaimed to be by his
                    family after switching to all vegan style recipes. His restaurant attracted many customers,
                    who not only loved the food, but the story behind it all. His message to customers was that
                    healthy food soothes the soul, nourishes the body, and makes you feel at home. Watson passed
                    away in 2021, but his message has been received around the country, leading to the opening of
                    two other locations in the tristate area in his honor.</p>
